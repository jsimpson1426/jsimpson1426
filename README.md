- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsimpson1426, but you can call me Josh! If you want to take a look at what I can do, check out my portfolio <a href="http://www.joshdev.co" target="_blank"> here! </a>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about graphQL and how to implement it in node. I'm also learning about pcb design and firmware development.
- 👀 I love video games and building custom keyboards! Keyboards are why I'm looking into pcb design. I'm learning, but hopefully I can churn out a few designs 
      and figure out something that works well! I also like to play blues guitar and maybe get into Jazz and music theory, though I may need a bit more free time for that!
- 💞️ Speaking of music, I’d love to work on any project that involves signal processing in sound waves! I'm very interested in song recognition software like Shazam and its applications in other areas then entertainment. One potential application that I've seen is using the sound signature of an engine to identify the make, model and year of a car. Another I looked into briefly was identifying the caliber, or even model, of a firearm based on its sound signature.
