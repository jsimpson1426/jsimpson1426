- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsimpson1426, but you can call me Josh!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about graphQL and how to implement it in node. I'm also learning about pcb design and firmware development.
- 👀 I’m interested in music, video games and keyboards! Keyboards are why I'm looking into pcb design. I'm learning, but hopefully I can churn out a few designs 
      and figure out something that works well!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves signal processing in sound waves. I'm very interested in song recognition software like Shazam and its applications in
      areas. One potential application that I've seen is using the sound signature of an engine to identify the make, model and year of a car. Another I looked into briefly was
      identifying the caliber, or even model, of a firearm based on its sound signature.
- 📫 If you are interested in collaboration or need a new full-stack engineer on your team, you can reach me at simpsonjoshuam@gmail.com.
